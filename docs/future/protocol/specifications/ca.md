## Introduction

In Chain Protocol 2, asset IDs and amounts in transaction inputs and outputs can be kept private. These details are encrypted homomorphically: the network can verify that transactions are balanced (and, consequently, that the ledger is consistent) without learning exact asset IDs or amounts. Designated recipients and auditors share the encryption key that gives them “read access” to the asset ID and amount of a particular output.

Blinded amounts can be selectively revealed to the network in order to make them visible to smart contracts. The asset ID and the amount can be hidden or revealed independently enabling fine-grained privacy control.

Amounts can have *absolute privacy*, independent of the structure and history of any given transaction. Asset IDs are *relatively private*, meaning their privacy set is the union of the sets of possible asset IDs committed to by transaction inputs.

[[NOTES: Define absolute privacy. Define privacy set.]]

Cryptographic proofs for blinded asset IDs and blinded amounts require relatively large amounts of data (typically 3 to 5 KB). However, almost 80% of that space can be reused to encrypt a confidential message addressed to a designated recipient of the transaction output. The protocol specifies algorithms for encrypting and decrypting this data, along with parameters that allow the user creating the transaction to tune the size of the proofs trading off some of the privacy for lower bandwidth requirements (e.g. blinding a 32-bit amount requires half as much data compared to blinding a full-resolution 64-bit integer).

Present scheme is *perfectly binding*, but only *computationally hiding*. (In fact, [it is impossible](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41822/why-cant-the-commitment-schemes-have-both-information-theoretic-hiding-and-bind) for a commitment scheme to be both perfectly binding and perfectly hiding at the same time.) This means that breaking elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) will not compromise the integrity of the commitments, that bind the value perfectly and do not allow manipulations using any amount of computational resources. However, breaking ECDLP can compromise commitments’ hiding property, which rests on discovery of the blinding factor being computationally hard (which is the case only until a powerful quantum computer is made or there is a breakthrough in solving ECDLP with classical computers).

## Usage

In this section we will provide a brief overview of various ways to use confidential assets.

### Confidential issuance

1. Issuer chooses asset ID and an amount to issue.
2. Issuer generates issuance [keys](#keys) unique for this issuance.
3. Issuer chooses a set of other asset IDs to add into the *issuance anonymity set*.
4. Issuer sorts the union of the issuance asset ID and anonymity set lexicographically.
5. For each asset ID, where issuance program does not check an issuance key, issuer [creates a transient issuance key](#transient-issuance-key).
6. Issuer provides arguments for each issuance program of each asset ID.
7. Issuer [encrypts issuance](#encrypt-issuance): generates asset ID and value commitments and provides necessary range proofs. Issuer uses ID of the [Nonce](blockchain.md#nonce) as `nonce` and [issuance program](blockchain.md#program) as `message`.
8. Issuer remembers values `(AC,c,f)` to help complete the transaction. Once outputs are fully or partially specified, these values can be discarded.
9. Issuer proceeds with the rest of the transaction creation. See [simple transfer](#simple-transfer) and [multi-party transaction](#multi-party-transaction) for details.

### Simple transfer

1. Recipient generates the following parameters and sends them privately to the sender:
    * amount and asset ID to be sent,
    * control program,
    * [encryption keys](#keys).
2. Sender composes a transaction with an unencrypted output with a given control program.
3. Sender adds necessary amount of inputs to satisfy the output:
    1. For each unspent output, sender pulls values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` from its DB.
    2. If the unspent output is not confidential, then:
        * `AC=(A,O)`, [nonblinded asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment)
        * `c=0`
        * `f=0`
4. If sender needs to add a change output:
    1. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output.
    2. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q`.
    3. Sender adds unencrypted change output.
    4. Sender generates [encryption keys](#keys) for the change output.
    5. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the change output with an additional excess factor `q`.
5. If sender does not need a change output:
    1. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) of the inputs to create an excess factor `q`.
    2. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output with an additional excess factor `q`.
6. Sender stores values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
7. Sender publishes the transaction.
8. Recipient receives the transaction and identifies its output via its control program.
9. Recipient uses its [encryption keys](#keys) to [decrypt output](#decrypt-output).
10. Recipient stores resulting `(assetid,value,H,c,f)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
11. Recipient separately stores decrypted plaintext payload with the rest of the reference data. It is not necessary for spending.


### Multi-party transaction

1. All parties communicate out-of-band payment details (how much is being paid for what), but not cryptographic material or control programs.
2. Each party:
    1. Generates cleartext outputs: (amount, asset ID, control program, [encryption keys](#keys)). These include both requested payment ("I want to receive €10") and the change ("I send back to myself $142").
    2. [Encrypts](#encrypt-output) each output.
    3. [Balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q[i]`.
    4. For each output, stores values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` associated with that output in its DB for later spending.
    5. Sends `q[i]` to the party that finalizes transaction.
3. Party that finalizes transaction:
    1. Receives `{q[i]}` values from all other parties (including itself).
    2. Sums all excess factors: `qsum = ∑q[i]`
    3. [Creates excess commitment](#create-excess-commitment) out of `qsum`: `QG=qsum·G, QJ=qsum·J` and signs it.
    4. Finalizes transaction by placing the [excess commitment](#excess-commitment) in the transaction.
    5. Publishes the transaction.
4. If the amounts and blinding factors are balanced, transaction is valid and included in the blockchain. Parties can not see each other’s outputs, but only their own.


## Cryptographic primitives

### Elliptic curve

**The elliptic curve** is edwards25519 as defined by [[RFC7748](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748)].

`L` is the **order of edwards25519** as defined by \[[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)\].

L = 2<sup>252</sup>+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.

### Scalar

A _scalar_ is an integer in the range from `0` to `L-1` where `L` is the order of [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve) subgroup.
Scalars are encoded as little-endian 32-byte integers.

### Points

#### Point

A point is a two-dimensional point on [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve).
Points are encoded according to [RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).

#### Point Pair

A vector of two elliptic curve [points](#point). Point pair is encoded as 64-byte string composed of 32-byte encodings of each point.

#### Point operations

Elliptic curve *points* support two operations:

1. Addition/subtraction of points (`A+B`, `A-B`)
2. Scalar multiplication (`a·B`).

These operations are defined as in \[[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)\].

*Point pairs* support the same operations defined as:

1. Sum of two pairs is a pair of sums:

        (A,B) + (C,D) == (A+C, B+D)

2. Multiplication of a pair by a [scalar](#scalar) is a pair of scalar multiplications of each point:

        x·(A,B) == (x·A,x·B)


#### Zero point

_Zero point_ `O` is a representation of the _point at infinity_, identity element in the [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve) subgroup. It is encoded as follows:

    O = 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

#### Generators

**Primary generator point** (`G`) is the elliptic curve point specified as "B" in Section 5.1 of [[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)].

Generator `G` has the following 32-byte encoding:

    G = 0x5866666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666

**Secondary generator point** (`J`) is the elliptic curve point defined as decoded hash of the primary generator `G` using [PointHash](#pointhash) function:

    J = PointHash("J", Encode(G))

Generator `J` has the following 32-byte encoding:

    J = 0x0TBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBDTBD


### Hash functions

The following hash functions are based on SHA-3 Derived Functions as specified by [NIST SP 800-185](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-185.pdf).

Each hash function has a _function name_ string `F` that is appended to a customization string `S` (in NIST terms) to allow efficient precomputation of any specific hash function instance; this is due to customization strings being padded to 168 bytes that are fully permuted using Keccak function.

#### Hash256

`Hash256(F,X)` is a secure hash function that takes a list of input strings `X` and outputs a 256-bit hash.

    Hash256(F,X) = TupleHash128(X, L=256, S="ChainCA." || F)

#### StreamHash

`StreamHash(F,X,n)` is a secure extendable-output hash function that takes a sequence of variable-length binary strings `X` as input
and outputs a variable-length hash string depending on a number of bytes (`n`) requested.

    StreamHash(F, X, n) = TupleHashXOF128(X, L=n·8, S="ChainCA." || F)

#### ScalarHash

`ScalarHash(F,X)` is a secure hash function that takes a variable-length binary strings `F` (function name) and `X` as inputs and outputs a [scalar](#scalar). It is based on NIST recommendation to output at least extra 128 bits in order to make bias negligible ([NIST SP 800-185](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-185.pdf), Appendix B, p. 25).

`ScalarHash` uses 512-bit output to take advantage of an existing implementation of “reduce” operation in Ed25519 libraries defined for 512-bit strings (even though a 381-bit output provides a sufficient security level).

1. For the input sequence of strings `X` compute a 512-bit hash `h`:

        h = TupleHash128(X, L=512, S="ChainCA." || F)

2. Interpret `h` as a little-endian integer and reduce modulo subgroup [order](#elliptic-curve) `L`:

        s = h mod L

3. Return the resulting scalar `s`.

#### PointHash

`PointHash(F,X)` is a secure hash function that takes a list of input strings `X` and returns a valid point in Ed25519 subgroup.

It is defined as follows:

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Append counter to a list of input strings `X`,  where `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit unsigned integer using little-endian convention:

        X’ = {uint64le(counter), X[0], ..., X[n-1]}

3. Calculate hash using [Hash256](#hash256) function defined above:

        h = Hash256(F, X’)

4. Decode the resulting hash as a [point](#point) `P` on the elliptic curve.
5. If the point is not a valid curve point, increment `counter` and go back to step 2. The probability of failure is 0.5.
6. Multiply `P` by cofactor to eliminate elements outside the subgroup order:

        P’ = 8·P

7. Return `P’`.



### Ring Signature

Ring signature is a variable-length string representing a signature of knowledge of a one private key among an ordered set of public keys (specified separately). In other words, ring signature implements an OR function of the public keys: “I know the private key for A, or B or C”. Ring signatures are used in [asset range proofs](#asset-range-proof).

The ring signature is encoded as a string of `n+1` 32-byte elements where `n` is the number of public keys provided separately (typically stored or imputed from the data structure containing the ring signature):

    {e, s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]}

Each 32-byte element is an integer coded using little endian convention. I.e., a 32-byte string `x` `x[0],...,x[31]` represents the integer `x[0] + 2^8 · x[1] + ... + 2^248 · x[31]`.

Ring signature described below supports proving knowledge of multiple discrete logarithms at once.

#### Ring Signature Message Hash

This is an example of the message hash that can be used with the ring signature.

The resulting hash unambiguously commits to all base points, public keys, and a message string.

Derived algorithms (e.g. [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof)) can use a different hash that
commits to the same inputs indirectly.

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string to be signed.
2. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
3. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
4. `{P[i,u]}`: `n·M` [points](#point) representing the public keys.

**Output:**

    msghash = Hash256("RS.msg", {byte(48+M), B[0],...,B[M-1], P[0,0],...,P[n-1,0], ..., P[0,M-1],...,P[n-1,M-1], msg})


#### Create Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msghash`: the hash being signed that commits to all base points `{B[u]}` and public keys `{P[i,u]}`. See [Ring Signature Message Hash](#ring-signature-message-hash) for an example.
2. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
3. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
4. `{P[i,u]}`: `n·M` [points](#point) representing the public keys.
5. `j`: the index of the designated public key, so that `P[j,u] == p·B[u]` for `u` in `0..M-1`.
6. `p`: the secret [scalar](#scalar) representing a private key for the public keys `P[u,j]`.

**Output:** `{e0, s[0], ..., s[n-1]}`: the ring signature, `n+1` 32-byte elements.

**Algorithm:**

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Calculate a sequence of: `n-1` 32-byte random values, 64-byte `nonce` and 1-byte `mask`: `{r[i], nonce, mask} = StreamHash("RS.rand", {uint64le(counter), msghash, p, uint64le(j)}, 32·(n-1) + 64 + 1)`, where:
    * `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,
    * `p` is encoded as a 256-bit little-endian integer,
    * `j` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
3. Calculate `k = nonce mod L`, where `nonce` is interpreted as a 64-byte little-endian integer and reduced modulo subgroup order `L`.
4. Calculate the initial e-value, let `i = j+1 mod n`:
    1. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`: calculate `R[u,i]` as the [point](#point) `k·B[u]`.
    2. Define `w[j]` as `mask` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[j] = mask & 0xf0`.
    3. Calculate `e[i] = ScalarHash("RS.e", {R[0,i], ..., R[M-1,i], msghash, uint64le(i), w[j]})` where `i` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
5. For `step` from `1` to `n-1` (these steps are skipped if `n` equals 1):
    1. Let `i = (j + step) mod n`.
    2. Calculate the forged s-value `s[i] = r[step-1]`.
    3. Define `z[i]` as `s[i]` with the most significant 4 bits set to zero.
    4. Define `w[i]` as a most significant byte of `s[i]` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[i] = s[i][31] & 0xf0`.
    5. Let `i’ = i+1 mod n`.
    6. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`:
        1. Calculate point `R[u,i’] = z[i]·B[u] - e[i]·P[i,u]`.
    7. Calculate `e[i’] = ScalarHash("RS.e", {R[0,i’], ..., R[M-1,i’], msghash, uint64le(i’), w[i]})` where `i’` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
6. Calculate the non-forged `z[j] = k + p·e[j] mod L` and encode it as a 32-byte little-endian integer.
7. If `z[j]` is greater than 2<sup>252</sup>–1, then increment the `counter` and try again from the beginning. The chance of this happening is below 1 in 2<sup>124</sup>.
8. Define `s[j]` as `z[j]` with 4 high bits set to high 4 bits of the `mask`.
9. Return the ring signature `{e[0], s[0], ..., s[n-1]}`, total `n+1` 32-byte elements.


#### Validate Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msghash`: the hash being signed that commits to all base points `{B[u]}` and public keys `{P[i,u]}`. See [Ring Signature Message Hash](#ring-signature-message-hash) for an example.
2. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
3. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
4. `{P[i,u]}`: `n·M` [points](#point) representing the public keys.
5. `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]`: ring signature consisting of `n+1` 32-byte elements.


**Output:** `true` if the verification succeeded, `false` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
    1. Define `z[i]` as `s[i]` with the most significant 4 bits set to zero (see note below).
    2. Define `w[i]` as a most significant byte of `s[i]` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[i] = s[i][31] & 0xf0`.
    3. Let `i’ = i+1 mod n`.
    4. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`:
        1. Calculate point `R[u,i’] = z[i]·B[u] - e[i]·P[u,i]`.
    5. Calculate `e[i’] = ScalarHash("RS.e", {R[0,i’], ..., R[M-1,i’], msghash, i’, w[i]})` where `i’` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
2. Return true if `e[0]` equals `e[n]`, otherwise return false.

Note: when the s-values are decoded as little-endian integers we must set their 4 most significant bits to zero in order to restore the original scalar as produced while [creating the range proof](#create-asset-range-proof). During signing the non-forged s-value has its 4 most significant bits set to random bits to make it indistinguishable from the forged s-values.




### Borromean Ring Signature

Borromean ring signature ([Maxwell2015](https://github.com/Blockstream/borromean_paper)) is a data structure representing several [ring signatures](#ring-signature) compactly joined with an AND function of the ring signatures: “I know the private key for (A or B) and (C or D)”. Borromean ring signatures are used in [value range proofs](#value-range-proof) that prove the range of multiple digits at once.

The borromean ring signature is encoded as a sequence of 32-byte elements.

    {e, s[i,j]...}

Where:

* `i` is in range `0..n` where `n` is the number of rings.
* `j` is in range `0..m` where `m` is the number of signatures per ring.

Example: a [value range proof](#value-range-proof) for a 4-bit mantissa has 9 elements in its borromean ring signature:

    {
      e,
      s[0,0], s[0,1], s[0,2], s[0,3], # base-4 digit at position 0 (proof for the lower two bits)
      s[1,0], s[1,1], s[1,2], s[1,3], # base-4 digit at position 1 (proof for the higher two bits)
    }

#### Borromean Ring Signature Message Hash

This is an example of the message hash that can be used with the borromean ring signature.

The resulting hash unambiguously commits to the structure of the signature, all base points, public keys, and a message string.

Derived algorithms (e.g. [value range proof](#value-range-proof)) can use a different hash that
commits to the same inputs indirectly.

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string to be signed.
2. `n`: number of rings.
3. `m`: number of signatures in each ring.
4. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
5. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
6. `{P[i,j,u]}`: `n·m·M` [points](#point) representing public keys.

**Output:**

    msghash = Hash256("BRS.msg", {byte(48+M), uint64le(n), uint64le(m), {B[u]}, {P[i,j,u]}, msg})

 Where `n` and `m` are encoded as 64-bit little-endian integers.


#### Create Borromean Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msghash`: the hash being signed that commits to all public parameters. See [Borromean Ring Signature Message Hash](#borromean-ring-signature-message-hash) for an example.
2. `n`: number of rings.
3. `m`: number of signatures in each ring.
4. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
5. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
6. `{P[i,j,u]}`: `n·m·M` [points](#point) representing public keys.

9. `{payload[i]}`: sequence of `n·m` random 32-byte elements.

**Output:** `{e0, s[0,0], ..., s[i,j], ..., s[n-1,m-1]}`: the [borromean ring signature](#borromean-ring-signature), `n·m+1` 32-byte elements.

**Algorithm:**

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Let `cnt` byte contain lower 4 bits of `counter`: `cnt = counter & 0x0f`.
3. Calculate a sequence of `n·m` 32-byte random overlay values: `{o[i]} = StreamHash("BRS.Overlay", {uint64le(counter), msghash, {p[i]}, {uint64le(j[i])}}, 32·n·m)`, where:
    * `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,
    * private keys `{p[i]}` are encoded as concatenation of 256-bit little-endian integers,
    * secret indexes `{j[i]}` are encoded as concatenation of 64-bit little-endian integers.
4. Define `r[i] = payload[i] XOR o[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n·m - 1`.
5. For `t` from `0` to `n-1` (each ring):
    1. Let `j = j[t]`
    2. Let `x = r[m·t + j]` interpreted as a little-endian integer.
    3. Define `k[t]` as the lower 252 bits of `x`.
    4. Define `mask[t]` as the higher 4 bits of `x`.
    5. Define `w[t,j]` as a byte with lower 4 bits set to zero and higher 4 bits equal `mask[t]`.
    6. Calculate the initial e-value for the ring:
        1. Let `j’ = j+1 mod m`.
        2. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`:
            1. Calculate `R[t,j’,u]` as the point `k[t]·B[u]`.
        3. Calculate `e[t,j’] = ScalarHash("BRS.e", {byte(cnt), R[t,j’,0], ..., R[t,j’,M-1], msghash, uint64le(t), uint64le(j’), w[t,j]})` where `t` and `j’` are encoded as 64-bit little-endian integers.
    7. If `j ≠ m-1`, then for `i` from `j+1` to `m-1`:

### OLEG-ZKP

OLEG-ZKP is an acronym for “Ring Linear-Equation Generalized Zero Knowledge Proof” (“O” stands for “ring”).

It is a non-interactive proof-of-knowledge of secrets `x,y,z...` that statisfy one of statements `s1,s2,s3...` in zero-knowledge:

    NIPK({x,y,z...}, (s1 OR s2 OR s3 OR...))

OLEG-ZKP is a construct facilitating concrete statements and cannot provide security guarantees in abstract.
For the proofs of hiding and binding refer to description of a concrete instance of OLEG-ZKP that uses concrete statements.

**Examples:**

Ordinary Schnorr signature created by `x` and verifiable by public key `P`:

    OLEG-ZKP(msg, {x}, P = x·G)

Ring signature over public keys P and Q:

    OLEG-ZKP(msg, {x}, P = x·G OR Q = x·G)

[Asset range proof](#asset-range-proof) for ElGamal commitment `H,C` over assets `A1,A2`:

    OLEG-ZKP(msg, {c}, (H-A1 = c·G AND C = c·J) OR (H-A2 = c·G AND C = c·J))

#### OLEG-ZKP Message Hash

This is an example of the message hash that can be used with the borromean ring signature.

The resulting hash unambiguously commits to the structure of the signature, all base points, public keys, and a message string.

Derived algorithms (e.g. [issuance asset range proof](#issuance-asset-range-proof)) can use a different hash that
commits to the same inputs indirectly.

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string to be signed.
2. `{F[i,j]}`: `n·m` commitments for functions `{f[i,j]}`.

**Output:**

        msghash = Hash256("OZKP.msg", 
                          {
                            uint64le(n), uint64le(m), uint64le(l),
                            F[0,0]  , ..., F[0,m-1],
                            ...
                            F[n-1,0], ..., F[n-1,m-1],
                            msg

                               })

2. Return true if `e[0]` equals `e[n]`, otherwise return false.

Note: when the s-values are decoded as little-endian integers we must set their 4 most significant bits to zero in order to restore the original scalar as produced while [creating the range proof](#create-asset-range-proof). During signing the non-forged s-value has its 4 most significant bits set to random bits to make it indistinguishable from the forged s-values.

    F  = v·C + f·J

where:

* `(H, C)` is an [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment).
* `v` is an amount being committed.
* `f` is a blinding [scalar](#scalar) for the amount.
* `G`, `J` are [generator points](#generators).

The asset ID commitment can either be _nonblinded_ or _blinded_:

#### Create Nonblinded Value Commitment

2. `(H,C)`: the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment).

**Output:** the value commitment `VC` represented by a [point pair](#point-pair).

### Excess Factor

Excess factor is a [scalar](#scalar) representing a net difference between input and output blinding factors.
It is computed by [balancing blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) and used to create an [Excess Commitment](#excess-commitment).

#### Balance Blinding Factors

**Inputs:**

1. The list of `n` input tuples `{(value[j], c[j], f[j])}`, where:
    * `value[j]`: the amount blinded in the j-th input,
    * `c[j]`: the [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) in the j-th input (so that `H[j] = A[j] + c[j]·G`),
    * `f[j]`: the [value blinding factor](#value-blinding-factor) used in the j-th input (so that `V[j] = value[j]·H[j] + f[j]·G`).
2. The list of `m` output tuples `{(value’[i], c’[i], f’[i])}`, where:
    * `value’[i]`: the amount blinded in the i-th output,
    * `c’[i]`: the [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) in the i-th output (so that `H’[i] = A’[i] + c’[i]·G`),
    * `f’[i]`: the [value blinding factor](#value-blinding-factor) used in the i-th output (so that `V’[i] = value’[i]·H’[i] + f’[i]·G`).

**Output:** `q`: the [excess blinding factor](#excess-factor) that must be added to the output blinding factors in order to balance inputs and outputs.

**Algorithm:**

2. Calculate the sum of output blinding factors: `Foutput = ∑(value’[i]·c’[i]+f’[i], i from 0 to m-1) mod L`.
3. Calculate the [excess blinding factor](#excess-factor) as difference between input and output sums: `q = Finput - Foutput mod L`.
4. Return `q`.


### Excess Commitment

An excess commitment `QC` is an ElGamal commitment to a zero amount of an arbitrary asset (asset ID does not matter since the amount is zero). Since the amount is known to be zero, `QC` is simply a [pair of points](#point-pair) committing to the same [excess factor](#excess-factor) using two different generators. The pair comes with a Schnorr signature `e,s` proving the equality of the factors committed to by both points:

    QC = q·G || q·J || e || s || msg

Points `q·G` and `q·J` are encoded as 32-byte strings per [RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032). Scalars `e` and `s` are encoded as 32-byte little-endian integers. Remaining bytes `msg` represent an arbitrary message (which can be empty).

Excess pair `(q·G, q·J)` is used to [validate balance of value commitments](#validate-value-commitments-balance) while the associated signature proves that the points do not contain a factor affecting the amount of any asset.

#### Create Excess Commitment

**Inputs:**

1. `q`: the [excess blinding factor](#excess-factor)
2. `msg`: a variable-length string to be signed.

**Output:** `EC`, a binary string `QG || QJ || e || s || msg` where:

1. `(QG,QJ)`: the [point pair](#point-pair) representing an ElGamal commitment to `q` using [generators](#generators) `G` and `J`.
2. `(e,s)`: the Schnorr signature proving that `(QG,QJ)` does not affect asset amounts.
3. `msg` is an optional message string being included in the signature (can be empty).

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate a [point pair](#point-pair):

        QG = q·G
        QJ = q·J

2. Calculate the nonce:

        r = ScalarHash("EC.r", {QG, QJ, q, msg})

3. Calculate points:

        R1 = r·G
        R2 = r·J

4. Calculate Schnorr challenge scalar:

        e = ScalarHash("EC", {QG, QJ, R1, R2, msg})

5. Calculate Schnorr response scalar:

        s = r + q·e mod L

6. Return excess commitment `QG || QJ || e || s || msg`.


#### Validate Excess Commitment

**Input:** `EC`, a binary string representing excess commitment.

**Output:** `true` if the verification succeeded, `false` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. Verify that `EC` is at least 128 bytes long, otherwise return `false`.
2. Decode points `QG` and `QJ`. If points are not valid points on Ed25519 curve, return `false`.

        QG = Decode(EC[0:32])
        QJ = Decode(EC[32:64])

3. Extract signature scalars `e` and `s`:

        e = EC[64:96]
        s = EC[96:128]

4. Extract message `msg` from the remaining bytes:

        msg = EC[128:]

5. Calculate points:

        R1 = s·G - e·QG
        R2 = s·J - e·QJ

6. Calculate Schnorr challenge:

        e’ = ScalarHash("EC", {QG, QJ, R1, R2, msg})

7. Return `true` if `e’ == e`, otherwise return `false`.



### Validate Value Commitments Balance

**Inputs:**

1. The list of `n` input value commitments `{VC[i]}`.
2. The list of `m` output value commitments `{VC’[i]}`.
3. The list of `k` [excess commitments](#excess-commitment) `{EC[i]}`.

**Output:** `true` if the verification succeeded, `false` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. [Validate](#validate-excess-commitment) each of `k` [excess commitments](#excess-commitment); if any is not valid, halt and return `false`.
2. Calculate the sum of input value commitments:

        Ti = ∑(VC[i], j from 0 to n-1)

3. Calculate the sum of output value commitments:

        To = ∑(VC’[i], i from 0 to m-1)

4. Calculate the sum of excess commitments:

        Tq = ∑[(EC[i].QG, EC[i].QJ), i from 0 to k-1]

5. Return `true` if `Ti == To + Tq`, otherwise return `false`.






## Proofs


### Asset Range Proof

The asset range proof (ARP) demonstrates that a given [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs. A [whole-transaction validation procedure](#validate-assets-flow) makes sure that all of the declared asset ID commitments in fact belong to the transaction inputs.

Asset range proof can be [non-confidential](#non-confidential-asset-range-proof) or [confidential](#confidential-asset-range-proof).

#### Non-Confidential Asset Range Proof

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                         | byte      | Contains value 0x00 to indicate the commitment is not blinded.
Asset ID Commitments         | [List](blockchain.md#list)\<[Asset ID Commitment](#asset-id-commitment)\> | List of asset ID commitments from the transaction inputs used in the range proof.
Asset Ring Signature         | [Ring Signature](#ring-signature) | A ring signature proving that the asset ID committed in the output belongs to the set of declared input commitments.
Asset ID                     | [AssetID](blockchain.md#asset-id) | 32-byte asset identifier.

Note: non-confidential asset range proof exposes the asset ID, but
still needs to prove that it belongs to the set of the admissible
asset IDs in order to provide soundness guarantees.


#### Confidential Asset Range Proof

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                         | byte      | Contains value 0x01 to indicate the commitment is blinded.
Asset ID Commitments         | [List](blockchain.md#list)\<[Asset ID Commitment](#asset-id-commitment)\> | List of asset ID commitments from the transaction inputs used in the range proof.
Asset Ring Signature         | [Ring Signature](#ring-signature) | A ring signature proving that the asset ID committed in the output belongs to the set of declared input commitments.


#### Create Asset Range Proof

**Inputs:**

1. `AC’`: the output [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) for which the range proof is being created.
2. `{AC[i]}`: `n` candidate [asset ID commitments](#asset-id-commitment).

**Output:** an [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof) consisting of a list of input asset ID commitments and a ring signature.

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate the message hash to sign:

        msghash = Hash256("ARP", AC’, AC[0], ..., AC[n-1], message)

2. Calculate the set of public keys for the ring signature from the set of input asset ID commitments:

        P[i] = AC’.H - AC[i].H
        Q[i] = AC’.C - AC[i].C

3. Calculate the private key: `p = c’ - c mod L`.
4. [Create a ring signature](#create-ring-signature) using `msghash`, [generators](#generators) `(G,J)`, `{(P[i], Q[i])}`, `j`, and `p`.
5. Return the list of asset ID commitments `{AC[i]}` and the ring signature `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]`.

Note: unlike the [value range proof](#value-range-proof), this ring signature
is not used to store encrypted payload data because decrypting it would reveal
the asset ID of one of the inputs to the recipient.

3. [Validate the ring signature](#validate-ring-signature) `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]` with `msg`, [generators](#generators) `(G,J)` and `{(P[i],Q[i])}`.

    2. Verify that [point pair](#point-pair) `(A’,O)` equals `AC’`.
6. Return `true`.





### Issuance Asset Range Proof

The issuance asset range proof demonstrates that a given [confidential issuance](#confidential-issuance)
commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs.
Some inputs to the [validation procedure](#validate-issuance-asset-range-proof) are computed
from other elements in the confidential issuance witness, as part of the [issuance validation procedure](blockchain.md#issuance-2-validation).

The size of the ring signature (`n+1` 32-byte elements) and the number of issuance keys (`n`)
are derived from `n` [asset issuance choices](blockchain.md#asset-issuance-choice) specified outside the range proof.

The proof also contains a _tracing point_ that that lets any issuer to prove or disprove whether the issuance is performed by their issuance key.

#### Create Issuance Asset Range Proof

When creating a confidential issuance, the first step is to construct the rest of the input commitment and input witness, including an asset issuance choice for each asset that one wants to include in the anonymity set. The issuance key for each asset should be extracted from the [issuance programs](blockchain.md#program). (Issuance programs that support confidential issuance should have a branch that checks use of the correct issuance key using `ISSUANCEKEY` instruction.)

**Inputs:**

1. `AC`: the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment).
2. `c`: the [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) for commitment `AC` such that: `AC.H == A[j] + c·G`, `AC.C == c·J`.

### Value Range Proof

Value range proof demonstrates that a [value commitment](#value-commitment) encodes a value between 0 and 2<sup>63</sup>–1. The 63-bit limit is chosen for consistency with the numeric limits defined for the asset version 1 outputs and VM version 1 [numbers](vm1.md#vm-number).

Value range proof can be [non-confidential](#non-confidential-value-range-proof) or [confidential](#confidential-value-range-proof).

#### Non-Confidential Value Range Proof

A non-confidential range proof demonstrates the non-encrypted amount and allows efficient verification that a given [value commitment](#value-commitment) commits to that amount.

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                         | byte      | Contains value 0x00 to indicate the commitment is not blinded.
Amount                       | varint63  | Amount

#### Confidential Value Range Proof

A confidential range proof proves that a given [value commitment](#value-commitment) commits to an amount in a valid range (between 0 and 2<sup>63</sup>–1) without revealing the exact value.

For the most compact encoding, confidential value range proof uses base-4 digits represented by 4-key ring signatures proving the value of each pair of bits. If the number of bits is odd, the last ring signature contains only 2 elements proving the value of the highest-order bit. All ring signatures share the same e-value (see below) forming a so-called "[borromean ring signature](#borromean-ring-signature)".

Value range proof allows a space-privacy tradeoff by making a smaller number of bits confidential while exposing a "minimum value" and a decimal exponent. The complete value is broken down in the following components:

    value = vmin + (10^exp)·(d[0]·(4^0) + ... + d[m-1]·(4^(m-1)))

Where d<sub>i</sub> is the i’th digit in a m-digit mantissa (that has either 2·m–1 or 2·m bits). Exponent `exp` and the minimum value `vmin` are public and by default set to zero by the user creating the transaction.

Field                     | Type        | Description
--------------------------|-------------|------------------
Type                      | byte        | Contains value 0x01 to indicate the commitment is blinded.
Number of bits            | byte        | Integer `n` indicating number of confidential mantissa bits between 1 and 63.
Exponent                  | byte        | Integer `exp` indicating the decimal exponent from 0 to 10.
Minimum value             | varint63    | Minimum value `vmin` from 0 to 2<sup>63</sup>–1.
Digit commitments         | [PointPair] | List of `(n+1)/2 – 1` individual digit commitments where `n` is the number of mantissa bits.
Borromean Ring Signature  | [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) | List of all 32-byte elements comprising all ring signatures proving the value of each digit.

The total number of elements in the [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) is `1 + 4·n/2` where `n` is number of bits and `n/2` is a number of rings.

1. `pt`: plaintext, a binary string of arbitrary byte length `n`.
2. `ek`: the encryption/authentication key.
3. `seed`: a unique seed per encryption (optional, empty by default) — could be a counter, timestamp, or a random string.

**Output:** `ct`: ciphertext, a binary string of byte length `n+32`.

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate an 8-byte `nonce`:

        nonce = StreamHash("Packet.Nonce", {seed,ek,pt}, 8 bytes)

2. Calculate a keystream, a sequence of `n` bytes:

        keystream = StreamHash("Packet.Keystream", {nonce,ek}, n bytes)

3. Encrypt the plaintext payload by XORing each byte of plaintext with the corresponding byte of the keystream:

        ct[i] = pt[i] XOR keystream[i]

4. Calculate 24-byte MAC using `ek` as a key and `ct||nonce` as a message:

        mac = KMAC128(K=ek, X=ct||nonce, S="ChainCA.Packet.MAC", L=24 bytes)

5. Return an encrypted packet `ep`, a sequence of `n+32` bytes:

        ep = ct || nonce || mac


#### Decrypt Packet

**Inputs:**

1. `ep`: encrypted, a binary string of arbitrary byte length `n+32`.
2. `ek`: the encryption/authentication key.

**Output:** the plaintext `pt` of length `n`, or `nil`, if authentication failed.

1. Verify that `ep` is at least 32 bytes long, otherwise return `nil`.
2. Split ciphertext `ep` into raw ciphertext `ct`, 8-byte `nonce` and 24-byte `mac`:

        ct    = ep[0:n]
        nonce = ep[n:n+8]
        mac   = ep[n+8:n+32]

3. Compute MAC for the ciphertext concatenated with the nonce:

        mac’ = KMAC128(K=ek, X=ct||nonce, S="ChainCA.Packet.MAC", L=24 bytes)

4. Compare in constant time `mac’ == mac`. If not equal, return `nil`.
5. Calculate a keystream, a sequence of `n` bytes:

        keystream = StreamHash("Packet.Keystream", {nonce,ek}, n bytes)

6. Decrypt the plaintext payload by XORing each byte of ciphertext with the corresponding byte of the keystream:

        pt[i] = ct[i] XOR keystream[i]

7. Return plaintext `pt`.

### Encrypt Output

This algorithm encrypts the amount and asset ID of a given output and creates [value range proof](#value-range-proof) with encrypted payload.
If the excess factor is provided, it is used to compute a matching blinding factor to cancel it out.

This algorithm _does not_ create [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof) (ARP), since it requires knowledge about the input descriptors and one of their blinding factors.

ARP can be added separately using [Create Asset Range Proof](#create-asset-range-proof).

1. Encryption keys:
    1. `aek`: the [asset ID encryption key](#asset-id-encryption-key) unique to this issuance.
    2. `vek`: the [value encryption key](#value-encryption-key) unique to this issuance.

2. `VC`: the [value commitment](#value-commitment).
3. `VRP`: the [value range proof](#value-range-proof).

In case of failure, returns `nil` instead of the items listed above.

**Algorithm:**

1. Encode `plaintext` using [varstring31](blockchain.md#string) encoding and split the string in 32-byte chunks `{pt[i]}` (last chunk padded with zero bytes if needed).
2. If the number of chunks `{pt[i]}` exceeds `2·N-1`, halt and return `nil`.
3. If the number of chunks `{pt[i]}` is less than `2·N-1`, pad the array with all-zero 32-byte chunks.
